# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## About Project

I built this project because I'm learning algorithm, and sorting algorithm is the one that I fascinated about. I want to build a website that can visualize how different sorting algorithm works behind the scene. In this project,I learnt few key concepts for learning algorithms, such as **recursion, divide and conquer, time & space complexity**, I will definitely update more algorithms in the future.
